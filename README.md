The Blue Alliance - Windows App
========================

[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/the-blue-alliance/the-blue-alliance-windows.svg?label=ready&title=Ready)](http://waffle.io/the-blue-alliance/the-blue-alliance-windows) [![Stories in Progress](https://badge.waffle.io/the-blue-alliance/the-blue-alliance-windows.svg?label=In%20Progress&title=In%20Progress)](http://waffle.io/the-blue-alliance/the-blue-alliance-windows)

A native UWP (Windows 10) app for accessing information about the FIRST Robotics Competition.

In the short-term, the app only targets desktop and mobile. As the project matures and gains more developers, the goal is to offer an IoT version (ex: pit dashboards from a Raspberry Pi) and even release the app on Xbox One when it becomes available.
